    <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines:</h2>
    <ul id="guidelines-list">
        <li class="guideline-items">No name calling. If you have to resort to that your point probably doesn't matter.</li>
        <li class="guideline-items">Please attempt to state your opinions as opinions and not fact. This is key in staving off unnecessary arguments.</li>
        <li class="guideline-items">Mind your language. While we are adults here please refrain from overuse of curse words. That doesn't mean NO cussing,
        just please use with respect. Also, be careful that your language is not abusive or threatening.</li>
        <li class="guideline-items">More advice than a rule: seek first to understand then to be understood. Meaning ask clarification questions before
        jumping to conclusions.</li>
        <li class="guideline-items">We probably won't solve all the world's or nation's problems so we can take this serious...but not too serious.</li>
        <li class="guideline-items">I reserve the right to boot people if they break these rules repeatedly.</li>
